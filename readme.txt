== Description ==

Are you looking to increase sales and attract customer attention instantly? 

The Sale Percentage Badge for WooCommerce plugin enhances your store by displaying the exact discount percentage directly on product images. 

Unlike the default WooCommerce sale badge, which simply says “Sale!”, this plugin makes discounts more visible, helping customers see exactly how much they’re saving—boosting conversions and engagement.
